Autobahn is an asynchronous RPC/PubSub protocol built on JSON/WebSockets.

This project provides Autobahn client libraries (Apache 2.0 license) for

  * JavaScript/HTML5,

  * Java/Android and

  * Python,

as well as

  * a Python/Twisted based general WebSockets and Autobahn server, and

  * a fuzzing[*] WebSocket server to test WebSocket client implementations
    for protocol compliance and leaks/performance

Initial code is contributed by Tavendo GmbH.

**
**    Getting started
**
********************************************************************************

You will need Python 2.6 or above and - preferably - the Python Setuptools from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools for automatic dependency installation.

Autobahn depends on Twisted, which will be automatically installed.

1. clone the repo
2. cd lib/python
3. python setup.py install

Instead of direct installation, you can also build Python eggs

  python setup.py bdist_egg

and Windows MSI installers

  python setup.py bdist_wininst

which you then can redistribute.

**    Fuzz Testing Firefox / Chrome

********************************************************************************

Autobahn implements WebSockets protocol version 8, more precisely, the current
draft version 10 of the WebSockets protocol spec, which you can find here:

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-10

Currently /08/01/2011), the only browser (I know of) which implement that version
are:

   - Firefox 7 ("Aurora") and Firefox 8 ("Nightly")
   - Chrome 14 ("dev-channel")

Other browsers currently only implement older, incompatible, deprecated versions
of the protocol. Autobahn will NOT work with those.

As soon as other browsers implement version 8 or above, we will test with those
of course also.

You can fuzz test your browser like so:

1. cd test/fuzzing
2. python fuzzing_server.py
3. open fuzzing.html in browser
4. click the buttons for the test cases

**    How to get your own WebSockets server up.
**
********************************************************************************

Please have a look at

test/echo/echo_server.py
test/echo/echo.html

It should be very easy to follow. Essentially, you create a server by
deriving from the class WebSocketServiceConnection

class EchoServiceConnection(WebSocketServiceConnection):

   def onMessage(self, msg, binary):
      self.sendMessage(msg, binary)

and overriding methods there.

Please note, that what you get with this is a plain/raw WebSockets server.

Autobahn provides more than this.

The reason is: after experementing a little bit, chances are that what you
really want to have is asynchronous RPC on one hand, and possibly
publish-subscribe event handling also. For this, there is a need for a thin-
layer on top of plain WebSockets.
