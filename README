Autobahn is an asynchronous RPC/PubSub protocol built on JSON/WebSockets.

This project provides Autobahn client libraries (Apache 2.0 license) for

  * JavaScript/HTML5,

  * Java/Android and

  * Python,

as well as

  * a Python/Twisted based general WebSockets and Autobahn server, and

  * a fuzzing[*] WebSocket server to test WebSocket client implementations
    for protocol compliance and leaks/performance

Initial code is contributed by Tavendo GmbH.
