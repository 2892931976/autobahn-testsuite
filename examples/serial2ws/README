This test demonstrates how to shuffle data between WebSocket
clients and a device connected via a serial port.

You will need PySerial installed. Then, connect your serial device, run

  python serial2ws.py

and open

  http://localhost:8080/

in your browser.


How it works:

   serial device => WS client

   The Autobahn-based server will dispatch data received as WAMP PubSub events
   to which clients can subscribe.

   WS client => serial device

   The Autobahn-based server provides RPC endpoints which clients can call,
   and which gets forwarded via serial to the device.
